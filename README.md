# VLSI.X411---SystemVerilog-Assertions-and-Formal-Verification
SystemVerilog Assertions and Formal verification course Summer 2022

In this course, you will be introduced to SystemVerilog (1800-2017 IEEE standard), a unified hardware design, specification and verification language that is being rapidly adopted by chip designers and verification teams to boost productivity and ensure first-pass silicon success. While it’s based on Verilog and some extensions, the SystemVerilog language improvements include enhanced scheduling semantics, rich data types, interfaces with emphasis on assertions, and formal verification—all covered in this course.

You will also be introduced to SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) concepts and syntax, using small examples and realistic design protocols. You will learn about immediate and concurrent assertions, their differences and use cases, and how to write assertions for formal verification. In the second part of the course covering formal verification theory, students will run the formal tool, debug a counter-example, and learn the refinement process.

This is a lab-based course giving you the opportunity to dive into key topics in detail—from language constructs to assertion coding guidelines that include practical examples of how to use assertions in verification. Students will also learn methodology choices and assertions in a formal context. The course provides hands-on exercises using assertions in simulation (VCS) and formal verification (VC-Formal).

Topics Include:
1. SystemVerilog new data types
2. SystemVerilog Interfaces
3. SystemVerilog Assertions
4. Formal Verification and apps

Learning Outcomes:
At the conclusion of the course, you should be able to -
- Understand Systemverilog data types, interfaces and their use cases.
- Understand the role of Assertions in the verification process.
- Identify functional blocks appropriate for verifying using SystemVerilog assertions.
- Create Assertion test plan based on specifications. 
- Write assertions for the given design specs and run them in simulation.
- Run SystemVerilog assertions using formal verification tool and analyze results.
- Be familiar with Formal verification Apps use models and applications.
